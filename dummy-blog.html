        <p>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of different typefaces
            Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
            will
            later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet
            available.
            Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as
            lyrics
            when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in
            use
            by typesetters since the 16th century.</p>

        <h2 class="sec-head">The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
        <p>Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different typefaces and layouts, and in general the
            content of dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability
            is
            of great importance: human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If
            the
            distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral
            judgement
            on the visual impact and readability of the typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page
            (layout or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random series of words
            or
            syllables. This prevents repetitive patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
            the
            comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively
            realistic
            so that the layout impression of the final publication is not compromised.</p>

        <h2 class="sec-head">Incomprehensibility or readability?</h2>
        <p>That is the question.
            The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century.
            Lorem
            Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a
            series of real Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the rhythm of
            most
            European languages in Latin script. The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of
            Lorum
            Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the viewer's attention from the
            layout.
